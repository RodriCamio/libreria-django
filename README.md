This Django application manages book data: name, cover, and description. It provides editing, deletion, and storage in a database.

## Introduction
I developed a CRUD application based on Django by following a tutorial. This application allows users to input information about books, including their title, cover image, and description, which is then stored in an SQLite3 database to avoid conflicts. Users have the ability to edit or delete the books they've added. Finally, there is a 'Nosotros' tab that briefly explains the reason behind the creation of this project. Explore this project to learn more about our work.
